Daily Driving Cost Calculator
A program that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion. The program should input the following information and display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work:

    Total miles driven per day.

    Cost per gallon of gasoline.

    Average miles per gallon.

    Parking fees per day.
 
    Tolls per day.

    Write the algorithm together as a group. This algorithm must be included in your header block documentation for your program.

  

    Write and debug the program. The name of the program file should be carpool<group#>.cpp

    ((Total miles driven per day)/(Average miles per gallon))*(Cost per gallon of gasoline) + parking fees per day + tolls per day
